# Bangalore House Price Prediction
I've developed a machine learning model that predicts house prices in Bangalore based on key features such as locality area, square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. 🏠✨

Project Highlights:
➔ Utilized Linear Regression for price prediction.
➔ Built a robust backend server using Flask.
➔ Designed a user-friendly website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key Features:
➔ Locality-Based Predictions: Adjusts prices according to different areas in Bangalore.
➔ User Input: Allows users to input specific details like square footage and number of rooms.
➔ Real-Time Predictions: Provides instant feedback on house price estimates.
